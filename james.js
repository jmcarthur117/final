You suspect it is that damn neighborhood cat crapping in your yard again.  You continue walking to your door.  As you start unlocking your door, you hear running behind you.  You try to turn around, but it is too late.  You died, and your body goes missing without a trace.  Did it have something to do with the black envelope?"

As you open the envelope, you quickly check your surroundings.  There is nothing to be seen.  You grab a letter out of the envelope and read what it has to say.  It says MEET ME AT THE PARK AT MIDNIGHT.  Color escapes your face as you stand there, petrified."

As you get over the fence, you hear something run past you."

You gulp and walk toward the hedge where all of a sudden, a cat scrams forward.  You sigh in relief.  Then you hear the hammer of a gun behind.
